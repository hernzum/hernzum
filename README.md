Hi, Iâ€™m @hernzum! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in electronics.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Arduino.
About Me
I am passionate about exploring the world of electronics, from understanding circuits to experimenting with microcontrollers like Arduino. My journey in this field is driven by curiosity and a desire to create innovative projects that merge technology with everyday life.

What I'm Currently Working On
I'm currently diving deep into Arduino programming, exploring its capabilities and experimenting with different sensors and actuators. Specifically, I'm working on projects related to automatic irrigation systems and soil moisture monitoring for plants. These projects aim to leverage technology to efficiently manage watering schedules based on real-time moisture levels in the soil.
